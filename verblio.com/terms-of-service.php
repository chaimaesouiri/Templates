It is your responsibility to review, and request edits on, all Submissions before purchase. When you select a Content Post from a Provider, or when a Content Post is selected on your behalf, you are contracting directly with the applicable Provider for the Content Post. Except as expressly set forth in these Customer Terms, Verblio makes no representation or warranties with respect to any Content Post. Verblio does not endorse any Provider or Submissions and Verblio hereby expressly disclaims any and all liability in connection with any and all Submissions. You understand and agree that you have no right, title, or interest in any Submission until it is selected as your Content Post for your purchase. You may not publish, disclose, distribute, access, or otherwise attempt to use a Submission prior to it being selected for your purchase, except that you may access and review a Submission for purposes of determining whether to purchase the Submission or to request changes to the Submission. Your publication, disclosure, or distribution of a Submission, in whole or in part, prior to selecting it as your Content Post will constitute your purchase of the Submission as your Content Post and may subject your Account to immediate termination, in Verblio’s discretion.</span></p>

You further agree that during the Restricted Period you will not, directly or indirectly hire or attempt to hire, as an employee, contractor, or otherwise, any individual who is, or during the preceding 12 months was, a Provider. Because the harm to Verblio would be exceedingly difficult to determine in the event of a breach by you of the foregoing restriction, the parties agree that, in the event of such a breach, you shall pay to Verblio, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty.
