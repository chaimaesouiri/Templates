                <p><strong>1. General provisions / Definitions</strong></p>
                <p><?=$namehost?> offers a software application (the &ldquo;<strong>Service</strong>&rdquo;) that helps businesses and agencies manage their social media profiles on Supported Platforms (as defined below). By using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not accept these Terms of Service you shall not (and shall not have the right to) use the Service.</p>
                <p>We reserve the right, at any time, to update and change any or all of these Terms of Service, in our sole discretion. If we do so, we will post the modified Terms of Service on <?=$ihost?> (the &ldquo;<strong>Site</strong>&rdquo;), though we will notify you of any changes that, in our sole discretion, materially impact these Terms of Service. Continued use of the Service after any such changes have been made shall constitute your consent to such changes. If a change has a material adverse impact on you, and you have contracted and prepaid for a certain term, you may notify us within thirty (30) days after being informed of that change that you do not agree with the change. If you do so, we will delay applying the change to you until your prepaid term ends, or, at our sole discretion, allow you to cancel your account, and we will refund any prepaid amount pro rata to you. If you use the Service after your prepaid term ends, all changes will apply to you. You are responsible for regularly reviewing the most current version of these Terms of Service, which are currently available at: <a href="<?=$host?>/terms-of-service"><?=$host?>/terms-of-service</a> . When we change these Terms of Service, we will modify the last revision date above.</p>
                <p>If you are accessing and using the Service on behalf of a company (such as your employer) or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that company or other legal entity to these Terms of Service.</p>
                <p>For the purposes of the Terms of Service, words and expressions beginning with a capital letter, whether singular or plural, shall have the following meanings (identical words or expressions without the capital letter shall be deemed to have the ordinary meaning):</p>
