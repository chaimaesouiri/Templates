  <h3>Payment Service</h3>

  <p>The Content Writers Billing and Payment Service ("Payment Service") enables Writers to make a Submission and enables Buyers to make payments for Writer Services.</p>

  <ol>
  <li><p>Legal Nature of Payment Service</p>

  <p>When you use the Payment Service to bill for or pay service fees, Content Writers acts as your agent based upon your direction and your requirements to perform tasks on your behalf. Content Writers holds your Account funds separate from its corporate operating accounts, and will not voluntarily make your funds available to its creditors in the event of a bankruptcy or for any other purpose. As provided in United States Bankruptcy Code, Section 541(d), Content Writers shall hold only legal title to, and not have any equitable interest in, the Account and any funds in it.</p>

  <p>CONTENT WRITERS IS NOT A BANK, AND AMOUNTS TRANSFERRED THROUGH OR STORED IN THE PAYMENT SERVICE ARE NOT INSURED DEPOSITS. You will not receive interest or other earnings on the funds in your Account. Content Writers may earn and retain interest on those funds, or may receive a reduction in fees or expenses charged for banking services or other compensation in respect of any balances in Accounts. By accepting Submissions as a Buyer and sending payments through the Payment Service or adding funds to your Account, you appoint Content Writers as your agent to obtain the funds on your behalf and to transfer the funds to the recipient that you designate, subject to the terms and conditions of this agreement.</p></li>
  <li><p>Buyer's Payment</p>

  <p>The prices posted for the amount and type of Writer Services a Buyer can purchase, including bundled packages, are displayed on the Site and subject to change at Content Writer's discretion. Any change in these prices shall apply on a going-forward basis.</p></li>
  <li><p>Authorized Payments are Final</p>

  <p>Your use of the Payment Service constitutes your agreement to pay for any amounts that you authorize us to charge against your Account and, as appropriate, your credit card, bank account, or PayPal. Such payments, once authorized, are final.</p></li>
  <li><p>Erroneous or Duplicate Transactions; Charge Backs</p>

  <p>Content Writers reserves the right to seek reimbursement from you, and you will reimburse Content Writers, if Content Writers discovers erroneous or duplicate transactions, or Content Writers receives a charge back from any Buyer's credit card company, bank, or PayPal for any reason. You agree that Content Writers has the right to obtain such reimbursement by charging your Account, deducting amounts from future payments or withdrawals, charging your credit card, or obtaining reimbursement from you by any other lawful means. Failure to pay for reimbursements of charge backs is cause for termination of your Account.</p></li>
  <li><p>Currency</p>

  <p>The Payment Service operates in U.S. Dollars and therefore Content Writers is not responsible for currency fluctuations that occur when billing or crediting a credit or debit card denominated in a currency other than U.S. Dollars, nor is Content Writers responsible for currency fluctuations that occur when receiving or sending payment via wire transfer, check or automated clearinghouse to and from your Account. Payments made to Content Writers in currency other than U.S. Dollars may take up to eight weeks to process, depending on relationships among the banking and payment systems between the two countries. Consequently, balance adjustments may be delayed.</p></li>
  <li><p>Withdrawal of Funds</p>

  <p>For Buyers, with respect to refunding a credit purchase, any refunds must be requested within 60 days of purchase and are subject to a 10% transaction fee if requested after 15 days of purchase. Credit refund requests after 60 days of purchase will not be granted. Content Writers exercises its own discretion in determining valid reasons for refunds.</p>

  <p>At the end of each month, the Payment Service will submit a U.S. Dollar payment via PayPal equal to the number of credits in the Writer's account. This payment will be made to the Writer's PayPal Account, which is set by default to the email address used by the Writer to register his or her Content Writer's Account. The PayPal Account may be changed at any time in the Writer's Account. Payment will not be made unless Writer has uploaded a signed W-9 form.</p>

  <p>The Writer's Account will be set to zero upon successful deposit to its PayPal account. If a Writer does not have a PayPal account, an email will be sent to its verified address notifying you of Content Writer's payment. The Writer will then be instructed by PayPal to set up a free PayPal account in order to use or withdraw the funds to a bank account.</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding any other provision of these Terms of Service, if Content Writers determines in its sole discretion that a Buyer or Writer has violated the conditions and restrictions of the Site or Terms of Service, Content Writers has the right to refuse to process the withdrawal.</p></li>
  <li><p>Hold on Account Funds</p>

  <p>Content Writers reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to place a hold on funds for Buyer payments to clear, or if Content Writers suspects monies may be subject to dispute or charge back or if fraud is suspected. Content Writers will release a hold as soon as practical.</p></li>
  <li><p>Agreement to Pay</p>

  <p>If, for any reason, Content Writers does not receive payment for any amounts that you have authorized to be paid through your use of the Payment Service or other Content Writers services, you agree to pay such amount immediately upon demand by Content Writers. You also agree to pay any interest charges, attorneys' fees and other costs of collection incurred by Content Writers in collecting from you the authorized but unpaid amount. In such case, Content Writers may, at its option, stop processing any further payments made by you and apply any amounts then held by Content Writers on your behalf toward any deficiencies, losses or costs that we have incurred as a result of your use of the Payment Service or other Content Writers services. We may also make appropriate reports to credit reporting agencies, financial institutions, tax agencies and law enforcement authorities, and cooperate with them in any resulting investigation or prosecution.</p></li>
